Specifies the query column to use when you group sets of records together to send as an e-mail
		message. For example, if you send a set of billing statements to customers, you might group on
		"Customer_ID." The group attribute, which is case sensitive, eliminates adjacent duplicates when the
		data is sorted by the specified field. See the Usage section for exceptions.
