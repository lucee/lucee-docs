# Lucee documentation source and builder

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lucee/lucee-docs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lucee/lucee-docs)

This repository contains the source and build scripts for creating Lucee's documentation. The website output of the docs can be found at [http://docs.lucee.org](http://docs.lucee.org).

Issues can be reported and tracked at [https://luceeserver.atlassian.net/projects/LD](https://luceeserver.atlassian.net/projects/LD).

Find out more about the project at: [http://docs.lucee.org/docs.html](http://docs.lucee.org/docs.html).

## Build locally

### Prerequisites

The only dependency required is [CommandBox](http://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox). Ensure that commandbox is installed and that the `box` command is in your path.

### Building the static documentation output

The purpose of the structure of the documentation is to allow a human readable and editable form of documentation that can be built into multiple output formats. At present, we have an "HTML" builder and a "Dash docs" builder, found at `./builders/html` and `./builders/dash` that will build the documentation website and dash docset respectively. The source of the documentation can be found in the `./docs` folder.

To run the build, execute the `build.sh` or `build.bat` script (from the CommandBox console) found in the root of the project, i.e.

	CommandBox:documentation>!./build.sh|bat

Once this has finished, you should find `./builds/html` and `./builds/dash` directories with the website content / dash docsets built.

### Running a server locally

We have provided a utility server who's purpose is to run locally to help while developing/writing the documentation. To start it up, execute the `serve.sh` or `serve.bat` script (from the CommandBox console) found in the root of the project, i.e.

        CommandBox:documentation>!./serve.sh|bat

This will spin up a server using CommandBox on port 4040 and open it in your browser. You should also see a tray icon that will allow you to stop the server. Changes to the source docs should trigger an internal rebuild of the documentation tree which may take a little longer than regular requests to the documentation.

When running locally there are the following urls available

* [Lucee documentation home](http://127.0.0.1:4040/)
* [Build all documentation](http://127.0.0.1:4040/build_docs/all/)
* [Build html documentation](http://127.0.0.1:4040/build_docs/html/)
* [Build dash documentation](http://127.0.0.1:4040/build_docs/dash/)
* [Import any new tags or functions](http://127.0.0.1:4040/build_docs/import/)
* [View static html docs](http://127.0.0.1:4040/static/) (you need to have built the html documentation first)
