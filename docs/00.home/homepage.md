Welcome to the Official [Lucee Server](https://lucee.org) Documentation

---

Lucee is a [high performance](https://community.ortussolutions.com/t/how-does-cfml-really-perform-compared-to-other-languages/9325), [open source](https://github.com/lucee/Lucee), ColdFusion / CFML server engine, written in Java.

The documentation here aims to provide a thorough reference and guide to all things to do with the Lucee Server. This includes reference material on both [[functions]] and [[tags]] as well as more in-depth articles in the [[guides]] section.

Our documentation is an open source and community driven effort. It is also a constant work in progress and we always welcome feedback, improvements and suggestions. You can find out more about contributing to the Documentation in the [[about]] section.

## Lucee 6.2

**New!** Lucee 6.2 is our latest stable release, with enhanced Java and Maven integration, Jakarta Servlet support and better runtime performance.

Lucee 6.2 up to 50% faster than Lucee 5.4, while using less memory.

Our Official Docker images and Installers for 6.2 all bundle Tomcat 10.1 and Java 21. This may cause issues with the switch to the Jakarta namespace, Lucee 6.2 supports both, but anything which integrates with Tomcat (i.e. urlrewrite) will need updating, see the [Jakarta](https://luceeserver.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=labels%20%3D%20%22jakarta%22) issues in our bug tracker.
