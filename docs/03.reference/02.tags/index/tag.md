Populates collections with indexed data.

The [[tag-index]] and [[tag-search]] tags encapsulate the indexing and searching utilities.

Collections can be populated from text files in a directory you specify, or from a query generated by a query.

Before you can populate a collection, you must create the collection using either the [[tag-collection]] tag or the Lucee Administrator.

Use [[tag-search]] to search collections populated via cfindex.
