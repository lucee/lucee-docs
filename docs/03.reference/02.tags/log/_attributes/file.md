Define instead a log reference in the Lucee Administrator and use the name of the generated log with the attribute log.
Specify only the main part of the filename.
For example, to log to the Testing.log file, specify
"Testing".
The file must be located in the default log directory. You
cannot specify a directory path. If the file does not
exist, it is created automatically, with the suffix .log.
