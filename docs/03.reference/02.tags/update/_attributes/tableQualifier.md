For data sources that support table qualifiers, use this field to specify the qualifier for the
table. The purpose of table qualifiers varies across drivers. For SQL Server and Oracle, the qualifier
refers to the name of the database that contains the table. For the Intersolv dBase driver, the
qualifier refers to the directory where the DBF files are located.
