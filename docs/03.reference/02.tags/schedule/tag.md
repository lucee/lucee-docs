Provides a programmatic interface to the scheduling engine. You can run a specified
  page at scheduled intervals with the option to write out static HTML pages. This lets you offer users
  access to pages that publish data, such as reports, without forcing users to wait while a database transaction
  is performed in order to populate the data on the page.
