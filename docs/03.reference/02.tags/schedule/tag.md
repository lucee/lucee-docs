Provides a programmatic interface to the scheduling engine.

You can run a specified page at scheduled intervals with the option to write out static HTML pages.

This lets you offer users access to pages that publish data, such as reports, without forcing users to wait while a database transaction
is performed in order to populate the data on the page.
