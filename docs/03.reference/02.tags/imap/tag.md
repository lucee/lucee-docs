Retrieves and deletes e-mail messages from a Imap mail server.
		This tag works exactly the same way as the cfmail tag. It has the same attributes.
		The Internet Message Access Protocol or IMAP is one of two of the most prevalent Internet standard protocols for e-mail retrieval,
		the other being POP3. Virtually all modern e-mail clients and servers support both protocols as a means of transferring e-mail messages from a server,
		such as those used by Gmail, to a client, such as Mozilla Thunderbird and Microsoft Outlook.
		Many implementations of webmail use IMAP to retrieve e-mail messages from a server and display them within a web browser,
		making the use of this protocol transparent to the user.
