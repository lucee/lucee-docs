Builds a table in a CFML page.

Use the [[tag-col]] tag to define table column and row characteristics.

The cftable tag renders data either as preformatted text, or, with the HTMLTable attribute, as an HTML table.

Use cftable to create tables if you don't want to write HTML table tag code, or if your data can be well presented as preformatted text.
