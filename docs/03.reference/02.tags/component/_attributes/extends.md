Name of parent Component from which to inherit Methods and Properties.

- A component in the same folder: `roles`
- Relative to the current folder, in a sub directory: `admin.roles`
- Using a mapping or relative to webroot, using dotted paths: `models.admin.roles`
- Absolute path using a mapping: `myapp.models.admin.roles` (where `myapp` is a defined mapping)

The `.cfc` extension is implicit and should not be included.

Paths use dot notation, not slashes.

Component paths are case-insensitive in CFML.
