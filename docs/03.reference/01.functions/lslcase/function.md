Converts the alphabetic characters in a specified string to lowercase, respecting locale-specific casing rules. This is particularly important for languages where the standard lowercase conversion rules do not apply, ensuring accurate and culturally correct text processing. The function defaults to the current page's locale if no locale is specified.
