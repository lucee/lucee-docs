Outputs the [swatch internet time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time) (or "beat time") of the passed local time.

It is a new system of time developed by Swatch, the Swiss watch maker. It involves setting the current day into 1000 &quot;beats&quot; instead of 24 hours. Internet Time eliminates the need for geographical time zones, perfect for the internet.
