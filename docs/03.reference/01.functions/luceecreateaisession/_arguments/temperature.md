Controls response randomness (0.0 to 1.0). Lower values make responses more focused and deterministic, higher values make them more creative and varied.

Recommended settings:

- 0.0-0.3: Technical analysis, debugging, code review
- 0.3-0.5: Documentation generation, error explanations
- 0.5-0.7: General purpose interactions
- 0.7-1.0: Creative content generation

For exception analysis and debugging, lower temperatures (0.2-0.3) are recommended for more consistent and precise responses.
