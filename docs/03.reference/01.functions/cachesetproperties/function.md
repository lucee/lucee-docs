description: This function is not supported by Lucee
---

This function is not supported by Lucee, because we consider it a security risk, as you can modify cache configuration without a password, you can use tag cfadmin instead. 

We will add support for this function in a future release, but then you can enable/disable this function in admin for every single cache instance.
