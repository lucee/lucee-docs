Specifies the generation mode of the ULID. If not defined, a standard ULID is generated. 'monotonic' ensures ULIDs increase monotonically, suitable for ensuring order in rapid generation scenarios. 'hash' mode generates a ULID based on hashing the provided inputs, useful for creating deterministic identifiers.
