The interpolation method for resampling. You can specify a specific interpolation algorithm by name (for example, hamming), by image quality (for example, mediumQuality), or by performance (for example, highestPerformance). Valid values are:

- highestQuality (default)
- highQuality
- mediumQuality
- highestPerformance
- highPerformance
- mediumPerformance
- nearest
- bilinear
- bicubic
- bessel
- blackman
- hamming
- hanning
- hermite
- lanczos
- mitchell
- quadratic
