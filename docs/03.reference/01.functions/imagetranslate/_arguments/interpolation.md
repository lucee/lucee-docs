Type of interpolation:

- nearest (default): Applies the nearest neighbor method of interpolation. Image quality is lower than the other interpolation methods, but processing is fastest.
- bilinear: Applies the bilinear method of interpolation. The quality of the image is less pixelated than the default, but processing is slower.
- bicubic: Applies the bicubic method of interpolation. Generally, the quality of image is highest with this method and processing is slowest.
