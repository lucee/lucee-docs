The following sort types are available:

- numeric: sorts numbers
- text: sorts text alphabetically, taking case into account (case sensitive, default)
- textNoCase: sorts text alphabetically, without regard to case (case insensitive)

or a function to be used as a comparator (introduced 6.2.1)

`function(key1, key2)`
