Encrypts a string. Uses a symmetric key-based algorithm, in
which the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt a string.
The security of the encrypted string depends on maintaining
the secrecy of the key. Uses an XOR-based algorithm that uses
a pseudo-random 32-bit key, based on a seed passed by the user
as a function parameter.
