If true, then if the input string contains letters and they are all UPPERCASE, then the input string is first lowercased.

When combined with the doAll argument, this is especially useful to clean user input of names when they are all UPPERCASE,

e.g. converting "SUSI Q. SORGOLIS" to "Susi Q. Sorgolis" while preserving the CaSe if the input is e.g. "Ronald McDonald"
