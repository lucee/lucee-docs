True: if the regular expression is found, the first array
element contains the length and position, respectively,

If the regular expression contains parentheses that
group subexpressions, each subsequent array element
contains the length and position, respectively, of
the first occurrence of each group.

If the regular expression is not found, the arrays each
contain one element with the value 0.

False: the function returns the position in the string
where the match begins. Default.
