The following masks can be used to format the full date and time and may not be combined with other masks:

- short: equivalent to "m/d/y h:nn tt"
- medium: equivalent to "mmm d, yyyy h:nn:ss tt"
- long: medium followed by three-letter time zone; i.e. "mmmm d, yyyy h:nn:ss tt zzz"
- full: equivalent to "dddd, mmmm d, yyyy h:nn:ss tt zz"
- ISO8601/ISO: equivalent to "yyyy-mm-dd'T'HH:nn:ssXXX"

The function follows Java date time mask.  For details, see the section Date and Time Patterns at <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html>
