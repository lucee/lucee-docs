* More navigation on Wiki (breadcrumb links, links related features together)
* Fix/complete content for the red broken links on wiki home page.
* Make the docs version specific for each point release.
* Preview of upcoming features to allow community discussion in early development stages.
* Higher priority documentation for Lucee exclusive features and compatibility differences.
* Consider integrating a comments widget that is unique for each documentation page
* Consider integrating links to the online documentation, google groups and lucee blog in lucee admin
* Something about catching timeouts. Note from Matt Q: To be clear, the correct thing to do is change the "General Error Template" that's set at ```/lucee/admin/web.cfm?action=server.error ??```
