* Make the docs version specific for each point release.
* Preview of upcoming features to allow community discussion in early development stages.
* Higher priority documentation for Lucee exclusive features and compatibility differences.

* Something about catching timeouts. Note from Matt Q: To be clear, the correct thing to do is change the "General Error Template" that's set at ```/lucee-context/admin/web.cfm?action=server.error ??```
