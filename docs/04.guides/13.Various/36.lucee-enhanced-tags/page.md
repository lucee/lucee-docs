### Enhanced Tags ###

Here you will find a description of all tags existing in the CFML standard but which are enhanced in Lucee with helpful features. All tags should work like the original definition in the CFML standard. Here only additional functionalities or attributes are described.

### Application ###

This page contains all the application framework tags.

**[[tag-application]]**

The CFAPPLICATION tag has three new attributes:

* mappings
* customtagpaths
* action

The first two are introduced in Lucee 3.0 in order to allow a user the same functionality like Application.cfc which is defining per application mappings or customtags. So what you can do is something like this:
Example:

```lucee
<cfset st = struct("myLocalMapping":"/opt/apache/htdocs/myMapping")>
<cfset lstCT = "/opt/custom1,/opt/custom">
<cfapplication ... mappings="#st#" customtagpaths="#lstCT#">
```

The action attribute allows you to add things to your application context. Normally when you want to change something in your application context (like timeoutsetting) you need to use all attributes in order to set everything correctly. The action accepts two different actions "update" and "create" which is the default value. The value "update" in the action attribute instructs Lucee to replace the settings passed in the other attributes of the tag. So if you want to add a temporary per application mapping you can do that wherever you like:

**Example:**

```lucee
<cfapplication action="update" mappings="#st#">
```

**Data & output**

This page contains a description of all changed tags regarding data retrieving and output. cfcache The tag cfcache has been enhanced with a certain functionality. Normally the tag caches a complete page depending on the contents of the url and form scope. In Lucee 3.0 you can now use the opening tag CFCACHE with the closing one in order to cache parts of your output. So for instance if you want to cache the header of your application you can do this in the following way:

```lucee
<cfcache action="content" timespan="#createTimeSpan(0,0,15,0)#">
  <cfinclude template="header.cfm">
</cfcache>
```

This caches the output of the file header.cfm for 15 minutes. It will be stored as a file in the WEB-INF/lucee/cfcache folder and will be read from this file for the next 15 minutes. In addition to the environment state (url, form etc.) you can use the "key" attribute to generate a key like you wish. This key could for instance be something like serialize(request). Please note this differs from CF9.

**[[tag-document]]**

The popular tag ( and ) is available since Lucee 2.0 and offers some improvements to the well known features. Next to the possibility to define a proxyserver and a corresponding proxyport, there are other attributes, which boost the flexibility of the tag. The attribute "src" and "srcfile" can not only convert text based contents into PDF, but even images and existing PDF documents. Converting PDF's into PDF's might at first glance not make a lot of sense, but the following example should show the options you have using this feature:

Example:

```lucee
<cfdocument filename="ab.pdf">
<cfdocumentsection srcfile="a.pdf" />
<cfdocumentsection srcfile="b.pdf" />
</cfdocument>
```

This example for instance concatenates two PDF documents into one new, which contains the content of both PDF's.

Create your own index by using the H1 - H6 HTML tags. In addition in Lucee 3.0 we introduced the boolean attribute htmlbookmark which converts the H1-H6 headlines into bookmarks of the document. This is a very helpful functionality.

Example:

```lucee
<cfcontent type="application/pdf"><cfheader name="Content-Disposition" value="inline; filename=test.pdf"><cfdocument format="pdf" bookmark="true" htmlbookmark="true">
<h1>Susi</h1>
My Susi description text
<h2>Peter</h2>
Funny
</cfdocument>
```

**[[tag-dbinfo]]**

Next to the full CFML standard functionality Lucee 3.0 supports the new type "users" which returns a list of all database users to the passed database.

**[[tag-dump]]**

For the tag <cfdump></cfdump> the new attribute "eval" was introduced, which can be used instead of the attribute "var".

The attribute "eval" receives a string as an entry, which is interpreted and used as a label for dump.

Example:

```lucee
<cfdump eval="structCount(form)">
```

is the same as

```lucee
<cfdump var="#structCount(form)#" label="structCount(form)">
```

Next to supporting all CF8 attributes, CFDUMP now supports the attribute abort="true", which instructs Lucee to abort the request after the dump. You can even write it as in the example below:

Example:

```lucee
<cfdump abort eval="request">
```

In addition as a goodie, if you hover over the label of a dump output, Lucee displays the code line and the file where the dump was produced:

**[[tag-http]]**

This tag has been enhanced with the attribute "addtoken". When this attribute is set to "true", the request cookies "cfid, cftoken, jsessionid" will be added to the request so that a request will be automatically recognized being from the same session. This can be compared with the behaviour of the tag CFLOCATION.

Example:

```lucee
<cfhttp addtoken="yes" url="http://www.lucee.ch/en/index.cfm">
```

**[[tag-query]]**

The tag CFQuery comes with a new attribute called "PSQ", which contains a boolean value determining whether in the body of the CFQuery-tags single quotes automatically will be escaped or not. Valid values are TRUE or FALSE.

Example:

```lucee
<cfset sql="select * from Users where name='susis'">
<cfquery name="test" PSQ="false">#sql#</cfquery>
```

This can be installed globally by setting it in the Lucee administrator under services / datasource.

Even though not documented, the CFML standard CFSTOREDPROC supports the following attributes:

* cachewithin
* cacheafter
* cachename

Lucee 3.0 now supports them as well.

**[[tag-flush]]**

The tag CFFLUSH can even be used inside a CFTHREAD tag in order to follow the process of a thread. The results in this case can of course interfere with the output generated outside the tag CFTHREAD

**[[tag-pdf]]**

The tag CFPDF has a couple of enhancements in comparison to the CFML standard in order to offer more flexibility.

Lucee offers you the additional attribute filter that gives you more flexibility when merging several PDF documents from a certain directory. It works exactly as the attribute filter of the tag CFDIRECTORY.

**[[tag-select]]**

The CFSELECT tag now offers the boolean attribute casesensitive which defines whether an option is selected based on a case sensitive matching of the value or not.

**[[tag-silent]]**

The tag cfsilent comes with a new attribute called bufferoutput. The reason for this is that Lucee eventually might output the data generated inside a CFSILENT, since when having the following code:

```lucee
<cfsilent>
  <cfoutput>This code is visible</cfoutput>
  <cfabort>
</cfsilent>
```

An abort outputs the data generated so far even though it is encapsulated inside a <cfsilent></cfsilent> tag. Not here comes the usecase for the new attribute. If you do specify the attribute bufferOutput and set it to false, then the output is not visible. Then Lucee writes it into the dev null device. This is not only much faster, but it saves memory as well. We will add a radio button to the Lucee Administrator which will allow to set the default behaviour of <cfsilent></cfsilent> and output="no" (this will follow in one of the next patches) inside a cffunction. So the code like follows:

```lucee
<cfsilent bufferOutput="false">
  <cfoutput>This code is not visible</cfoutput>
  <cfabort>
</cfsilent>
```

Then the line "This code is not visible" will not be displayed. It is a different behaviour than in the CFML standard, but since you can use it or not and since in the Lucee Administrator you will be able to define it's default behaviour to meet the standard, it is not considered as incompatible to the CFML standard.

### Extensibility ###

This page contains all the changed tags regarding extensibility.

**[[tag-function]]**

The CFFUNCTION tag now supports the returnformat="serialize" attribute. This will return the value of the function formatted in a Lucee serialized way (the same as if you would use the function serialize() in order to convert the return format).

Example:

```lucee
<cffunction name="susi" returntype="struct" returnformat="serialize">
```

**[[tag-imap]]**

The tag CFIMAP works exactly as the tag CFMAIL and accepts the same attributes. It just uses the IMAP format for connecting to the mailserver.

### File management ###

This page contains the changes of all file or folder related tags.

**[[tag-file]]**

The tag cffile was enhanced with the action "info", which allows you to retrieve information about a single file, similar to the return value of <cfdirectory action="list"></cfdirectory> for a whole directory. In addition to that the size (width and height) is shown if the target file is an image.

Example:

```lucee
<cffile action="info" file="lucee.jpg" variable="info">
<cfdump eval="info">
```

Contents of the variable "info": info.img.width:	width of the Image info.img.height: height of the image info.attributes: attributes of the file info.datelastmodified: last change info.name: filename info.size: size in bytes

Next to supporting resources, especially for the Amazon S3 resource we introduced a new attribute called acl. With this attribute you can set the authentication level of a certain file. It can be used like this:

Example:

```lucee
<cffile action="copy" from="/opt/apache/htdocs/myfile.txt" destination="/s3/myfile.txt" acl="public-read-write|authenticated-read|public-read|private">
```

Where /s3 is a mapping defined in the Lucee administrator pointing to an Amazon S3 bucket.

**[[tag-directory]]**

This tag supports resources as well. Especially for the Amazon S3 resource the CFDIRECTORY tag supports the new attribute acl as well. With this attribute you can set the authentication level of a certain directory. It can be used like this:

Example:

```lucee
<cffile action="create" directory="/s3/mydir" acl="public-read-write|authenticated-read|public-read|private">
```

Where /s3 is a mapping defined in the Lucee administrator pointing to an Amazon S3 bucket.

### Flow control ###

Description of all changed flow control tags.

**[[tag-thread]]**

The new CFTHREAD tag supports the attribute type. This attribute can contain either the string "thread" which is the default or "task". If you set the type to "task" then the code included within the CFTHREAD tag is executed in the task manager. In addition to the type attribute the CFTREAD tag supports the attribute retryinterval which allows you to set how often a certain task will be repeated before it will be marked as non executable. Read more about the new task manager.

**[[tag-abort]]**

This tag has been extended with the attribute "type". With this attribute you can define whether a request is aborted completely (request) or if only the current CFML-template is aborted (page). The default value for this attribute is "request".

Example: Template index.cfm

```lucee
Hello
<cfinclude template="main.cfm">
<cfoutput>#name#</cfoutput>
```

Template main.cfm

```lucee
<cfset name="Lucee">
<cfabort type="page">
<cfthrow message="your are to far">
```

Output: Hello Lucee

**[[tag-lock]]**

Since with the help of the attribute "throwOnTimeout" can be prevented that the tag <cflock></cflock> throws an exception, the following return variables have been introduced in Lucee: cflock.succeeded: Could the lock be applied cflock.errortext: Raised exception

**Page processing**

Description of all changed page processing tags.

**[[tag-content]]**

The tag CFCONTENT introduces full support for download managers. Download managers can request parts of a download and resume or pause running downloads. By using the new attribute "range" one can influence the functionality of resumable downloads. The following values are possible:

No - allows no partial downloads
Yes - the client (download manager or browser) is notified that partially downloads are possible
No value - the client will not be especially notified about the possibility of partial downloads. Nevertheless it is possible to resume paused downloads (most download managers try to download in parts anyway since you can always give it a try).

**[[tag-htmlhead]]**

```lucee
<cfhtmlhead action="read" variable="text">

<cfhtmlhead action="reset">

<cfhtmlhead action="append" text="susi">

<cfhtmlhead action="write" text="susi">
```

**[[tag-setting]]**

The attribute "enableCfOutputOnly" takes, like before, next to the boolean value, a new value named "reset". The reason for this is that if you use the command enableCfOutputOnly="true" several times, you don't have to close the setting as many times. You can use "reset" in order to make sure that enableCFOutputOnly was closed.

Example:

```lucee
<cfsetting enableCfOutputOnly="true">
<cfsetting enableCfOutputOnly="true">
<cfsetting enableCfOutputOnly="true">
<cfsetting enableCfOutputOnly="false">

Hello
<cfsetting enableCfOutputOnly="reset">

Lucee
```

Output: Lucee
