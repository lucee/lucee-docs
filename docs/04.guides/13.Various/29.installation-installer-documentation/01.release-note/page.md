The VHost Copier is designed to take care of the hassle of modifying Tomcat and related configs each time you need to add a new site to your server. Instead of having to modify the Tomcat server.xml and issue a Tomcat restart, the VHost Copier will update the necessary Tomcat config files, as well as add the new host using Tomcat's Host Manager application - no need for a Tomcat restart! Using the VHost Copier, you won't even need to think about configuring Tomcat. It happens automatically! Note While originally intended for this release, the VHost Copier has been delayed in order to allow for more complete and thorough testing.

The release of the VHost Copier has been delayed until further testing can be done. Thanks for your patience!

The Lucee 3.1.2.001 pl1 release contains MANY new features and improvements.

- Beta released June 11, 2010
- Officially released Oct 13, 2010

* [NEW] All OS's: The option to install a trial edition of FusionReactor is now available. (jordan)
* [NEW] All OS's: In-Use Port Detection has been added and improved in for Tomcat and FusionReactor. (bilal,jordan)
* [NEW] All OS's: Multi-Language is now supported (bilal)

* [NEW] Windows: A Notice has been included for WinXP installs stating that it's not officially supported. (bilal)
* [NEW] Linux: The option to select the Tomcat system user is now available. This makes it so folks who are uncomfortable running as root can easily select a different user to run under. (jordan)
* [NEW] Linux: A "change_user.sh" script is now available in the "sys" folder if you ever want to change the system user that Tomcat runs as. This script will detect existing users and create users or groups as needed. It will also rewrite the control scripts, so it *should* be compatible with all older versions of Lucee installed with previous versions of the installer. (jordan)
* [BUGFIX] Windows: IIS7 on Windows 7 is now fully supported (jordan)
* [BUGFIX] Windows: 32-bit Installer will now auto-detect 64-bit machines and will install the 64-bit connector when being installed on a 64-bit version of Windows. This is true for both IIS6 and IIS7. This avoids the "LoadLibraryEx" failure in IIS if a 32-bit connector has been installed on a 64-bit version of IIS. (jordan)

More rarely-used aspects of the JDK that ships with the installer may be removed at a later date in order to reduce the download size even more. (jordan)
* [Update] Windows: The JDK has been replaced with a simple JVM for Windows installs. The JDK was more then most folks needed, and switching to the simple JVM allowed for a smaller installer. (bilal)
* [BETA] OSX: A new OSX build is now available for BETA testing. (bilal)
The Following Translations are now available:

### Lucee 3.1.1.000 pl0 ###

The Lucee 3.1.1.000 pl0 installer was released to the "lucee-dev" mailing list on 10/12/2009 by Jordan Michaels. The major revision for the release was the new Install Platform generously provided by BitRock Software. Jordan was able to use the !BitRock Install Builder program to create the installers. The new install platform provided the ability to support Windows Installers in addition to Linux Installers, and made the process of maintaining those installers manageable. The following announcement was posted:

	Hey Folks,

	Vivio is proud to announce the immediate availability of Graphic
	Installers for both Windows and Linux. The graphic installers for
	Windows are completely new, so they will be the focus of my attention in
	this post. Those of you who are familiar with the console installers
	Vivio previously released, just know that the GUI installers available
	for Linux work in both GUI-mode and in Text-mode, so Linux has just been
	given more user-friendliness there.

	Downloads are available here:

	http://lucee.viviotech.net/

	Each installer contains everything necessary to get up and running right
	away, including Sun's JDK 1.6, Tomcat 6, and the latest production
	edition of Lucee. Download sizes range between 120-130 MB.

	The installers will also install the mod_jk connector if you select it.
	For Linux, Apache 1.3, 2.0, and 2.2 are all supported. For Windows, only
	IIS7 is supported. IIS6 users will need to install the connector
	manually. IIS7 is available by default on the following Windows OS's:
	Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008.

	The Installer will auto-detect IIS7. If you have IIS7 installed, the
	Lucee Installer will prompt you if you want the IIS7 connector installed
	as well. If you don't have IIS7 installed, you will not be prompted.

	I've received several requests for IIS6 support, so it may be added in
	the future. If you feel IIS6 would help you get others interested in
	using or continuing to use CFML, please add your voice and let me know.

	For Windows users, after the install is finished, you'll find links to
	the Lucee Administrator, as well as Lucee-Tomcat Service controls in
	your start menu. For convenience, the server.xml file (which needs to be
	modified each time you add a new site to your server) has also been
	linked to in the start menu. Just edit the file, restart Lucee-Tomcat,
	and your new domain will be all set.

	Please let me know if you have any questions or run into any problems.

	I've tested the Windows installer on Windows Vista, Windows 7, and
	Windows Server 2008. I've tested the Linux installers on CentOS 5 and
	Ubuntu Jaunty.

### Lucee 3.1.1 ###

The Lucee 3.1.1 installer was released to the "lucee" mailing list on 8/21/2009 by Jordan Michaels. It existed only as a Linux installer, as it was just a BASH shell script at the time. The following message was posted:


	Vivio's Linux Installer for Lucee has been updated. Downloads are
	available at the following URL:

	http://[NO LONGER ACTIVE]/

	Change Log:

	- [UPDATE] Uses latest version of Lucee 3.1.1
	- [UPDATE] Contains latest version of mod_jk (1.2.28)
	- [FIX] Fixed an error that would occasionally install the 32-bit mod_jk
	connector on a 64-bit system
	- [Fix] Fixed an issue where the installer would fail if run from the
	"opt" directory and Lucee was installed to the default of /opt/lucee.

	This installer is recommended for use with fresh installs.

	If you are using a previous version of the installer, you can update
	your installation by using the Lucee Administrator Upgrade feature.

	If you encounter any problems with the upgrade (I haven't tested), you
	may also upgrade by downloading the lucee-3.1.1.000-jars.tar.gz file,
	extracting it, and dropping the new Lucee jar files into the "[lucee
	install]/lib/" folder. Don't forget to restart with the "lucee_ctl"
	control script.

	Please let me know if you run into any issues with these installers or
	how they function once installed.

	Have fun!

### Lucee 3.1 BETA ###

The BETA version of the Lucee 3.1 installer was released to the "lucee-dev" mailing list on 7/2/2009 by Jordan Michaels. It existed only as a Linux installer, as it was just a BASH shell script at the time. The following message was posted:

	Hi Folks,

	Okay, I've got two versions set up and ready for testing at the following URL's:

	32-bit (122 MB):
	http://[NO LONGER ACTIVE]/downloader.cfm/id/77/file/lucee-3.1-BETA-linux32-pl0-beta.sh

	64-bit (116 MB):
	http://[NO LONGER ACTIVE]/downloader.cfm/id/78/file/lucee-3.1-BETA-linux64-pl0-beta.sh

	These are meant to be run for the console, since most server OS's don't use a windowed system in order to
	free up resources. Just open up a console and run the following

	Usage in CentOS/RHEL:
	# chmod 744 lucee-3.1-BETA-linux32-pl0-beta.sh
	# ./lucee-3.1-BETA-linux32-pl0-beta.sh

	Usage on Ubuntu:
	> chmod 744 lucee-3.1-BETA-linux32-pl0-beta.sh
	> sudo ./lucee-3.1-BETA-linux32-pl0-beta.sh

	Then just answer the questions it presents to you while you install. 90% of the documentation I wrote for
	this project on the OpenBD wiki also applies to the Lucee version, so it's nice that it's already mostly
	documented there:

	http://wiki.openbluedragon.org/wiki/index.php/OpenBD_Installer

	Once you've got it installed, you can start and stop Tomcat/Lucee with the "lucee_ctl" script. If you opt
	to have Lucee start at system boot, there will be two copies:

	/opt/lucee/lucee_ctl
	/etc/init.d/lucee_ctl (optional during install)

	Either of these can be used to start and stop the server:
	/opt/lucee/lucee_ctl start
	or
	/opt/lucee/lucee_ctl stop
	or
	/opt/lucee/lucee_ctl restart

	The administration URL's will be as follows:
	Admin:
	http://[SERVER IP ADDRESS]/lucee-context/admin/server.cfm
	ROOT WebApp:
	http://[SERVER IP ADDRESS]/lucee-context/admin/web.cfm

	Things to look for while testing:

	- Anything unusual happen during the install process? Even if you're not sure if it's unusual or not, let
	me know about it.
	- Anything not clear about the install process? How can I make it more clear?
	- Anything not work for this install that works for another installation method? This is usually the result
	of a default configuration error that needs to be corrected.

	IMPORTANT: If you're using a proper domain name, you will need to configure Tomcat's server.xml file for
	that domain. The server.xml file has been commented to help make it easier. Just copy and paste the example,
	and change the two values appropriately.

	This installer has been configured to work through Apache to make it more compatible with control panels and
	the like. It also installs the Apache connector (a process that usually requires compiling, etc), so
	hopefully that piece is a lot easier then normal.

	I look forward to any feedback you have to offer!
