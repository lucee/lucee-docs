## BlazeDS 3.2 integration ##

Lucee 3.x comes with BlazeDS 3.2, the Adobe opensource amf engine to communicate from a Flex application to a Java backend. Using AMF has a lot of advantages over the usage of REST or SOAP, if you need more information about BlazeDS please take a look at the documentation on <http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/blazeds/Developer+Documentation>.

The following is a short explanation about how to use BlazeDS with Lucee. First we start with an overall description about how to setup BlazeDS and how to test that it works, later down we will look at the different Lucee versions (Express, Server etc) and where you can find the individual pieces of the BlazeDS setup for your Lucee of choice. This text is based on Lucee 3.1.2, but should apply also to future versions of Lucee 3.x. It could change slightly for Lucee 4 though.

### Overall setup of BlazeDS ###

The different versions of Lucee come with slightly different preparations of the following, but to get an overview we start with a standard BlazeDS/Java setup. You can test this without Lucee, just download the blazeds.war file from <http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/blazeds/Downloads>, unzip it and copy it on the Java server of your choice. For example with tomcat you would put the unzipped blazeds directory into the webapps folder. In the following examples we will call this directory the /app-root directory.

To be able to use BlazeDS, we need to run the MessageBroker Servlet on the Java server. This can be achieved by putting the following code into the /app-root/WEB-INF/web.xml file:

```lucee
<servlet>
    <servlet-name>MessageBrokerServlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>flex.messaging.MessageBrokerServlet</servlet-class>
    <init-param>
        <param-name>services.configuration.file</param-name>
        <param-value>/WEB-INF/flex/services-config.xml</param-value>
    </init-param>
    <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
</servlet>

<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>MessageBrokerServlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/messagebroker/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
```

The default place where BlazeDS looks up its configuration is in the /app-root/WEB-INF/flex directory, where BlazeDS loads the services-config.xml. In this file the endpoints are defined that can be used in the ChannelSet of the Flex application as the endpoint url. For example in a standard setup like you can find it in the blazeds.war the AMFEndpoint you would have following url.

```lucee
http://{server.name}:{server.port}/{context.root}/messagebroker/amf
```

To test all this, you need of course also the BlazeDS jars on your classpath. For example in the blazeds.war you can find the jars in the /app-root/WEB-INF/lib directory. If you restart you server and browse to <http://yourdomain/yourcontext/messagebroker/amf> you should get a white page, if you get an error message, this would mean that either you server is not running, the MessageBroker Servlet is not running or you used different urls. :)

So far, so good, now let's take a look at what's specific for Lucee to work with BlazeDS.

## The LuceeAdapter ##

The remoting communication of BlazeDS is implemented in the flex.messaging.services.remoting.adapters.JavaAdapter and this approach above works fine if you want to call a single Java class on your backend, but because Lucee is more than just a single Java class, Lucee provides it's own implementation of the adapter which is the lucee.runtime.net.flex.LuceeAdapter.

To call a Lucee cfc from Flex you need the following: (In a Lucee Express all this is already setup for you)

Open the /app-root/WEB-INF/flex/services-config.xml and add the following channel definition in the <channels> tag:

```lucee
<channels>
    ...
	<channel-definition id="my-cfamf" class="mx.messaging.channels.AMFChannel">
	    <endpoint uri="http://{server.name}:{server.port}{context.root}/flex2gateway/" class="flex.messaging.endpoints.AMFEndpoint"/>
	    <properties>
	        <polling-enabled>false</polling-enabled>
	        <serialization>
	            <instantiate-types>false</instantiate-types>
	        </serialization>
	    </properties>
	</channel-definition>
    ...
</channels>
```

Now open the /app-root/WEB-INF/flex/remoting-config.xml and add the following code:

```lucee
<adapters>
    <adapter-definition id="cf-object" class="lucee.runtime.net.flex.LuceeAdapter" default="true"/>
    ...
<adapters>

<default-channels>
    <channel ref="my-cfamf"/>
    ...
</default-channels>

<destination id="ColdFusion">
    <properties>
        source>*/source>
    </properties>
</destination>
```

And last but not least, in your /app-root/WEB-INF/web.xml you need to add the following servlet mapping

```lucee
<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>MessageBrokerServlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/flex2gateway/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
```

If you now browse to <http://yourdomain/yourcontext/flex2gateway> you should have the same white page as above. Of course, to have this work, you need the LuceeAdapter on your classpath, which means that you need to copy the lucee.jar in your libs directory. To test this you don't need to setup Lucee completely, just adding the jar will already makes the example work, but without Lucee it's quite pointless. That's why we will look now at the three different Lucee versions and where you can find these settings after you have downloaded a new Lucee version.

## Using BlazeDS with Lucee Express ##

The Express version of Lucee has BlazeDS already setup to be used. But we will go through the different places where you can find the pieces of code explained above.

After you downloaded a Lucee Express and unzip it, you need to start it up once, so that Lucee creates the WEB-INF directory in the webroot folder. You can now verify that the MessageBroker Servlet is properly started by browsing to <http://localhost:8888/flex2gateway> which should return the already familiar white page.

So it looks like everything is where we have learned above, but if you look into the WEB-INF directory, you will notice that there is no web.xml. Instead open /lucee-express/etc/webdefault.xml. If you scroll down a little you will see that the MessageBrokerServlet is there as well the three mappings for /flex2gateway/*, /flashservices/gateway/* and /messageborker/*. To be backward compatible, OpenAMF, the opensource implementation of AMF0 is still there and you can request it over /openamf/gateway/*

That's it, if you look into the /lucee-express/webroot/WEB-INF/flex directory, you will find the services-config.xml along with the remoting-config.xml as you would expect. In the services-config.xml you will find four channels setup (my-cfamf, classic-cfamf, cf-polling-amf and my-cfamf-secure). Look into the remoting-config.xml and you will see that the LuceeAdapter is set to default true, the my-cfamf channel is the default channel and the ColdFusion destination is there, ready to be requested by the RemoteObject from a Flex application.

## Using BlazeDS with Lucee Express Server ##

After starting the Lucee Express Server version and browsing to <http://localhost:8080/flex2gateway> you will face a 404 Not Found error message. This is because by default BlazeDS is not yet setup on this version.

The services-config.xml and the remoting-confg.xml are setup as you would expect and you can refer to the explanations above, but the MessageBroker Servlet is not yet setup. You need to add the following code:

```lucee
<servlet>
    <servlet-name>MessageBrokerServlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>flex.messaging.MessageBrokerServlet</servlet-class>
    <init-param>
        <param-name>services.configuration.file</param-name>
        <param-value>/WEB-INF/flex/services-config.xml</param-value>
   </init-param>
   <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
</servlet>

<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>MessageBrokerServlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/flex2gateway/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
```

You can do this in two places, either add it to the /lucee-resin-express/conf/app-default.xml or add a web.xml into the /lucee-resin-express/webroot/WEB-INF directory and add the servlet there.

After restarting the server you can browse to <http://localhost:8080/flex2gateway> which should return the expected white page again, without error this time.

Actually, the missing servlet can perfectly be classified as a bug and should be corrected in future releases. :)

### Using BlazeDS with Lucee Resin Server ###

If you work with the full server version, go to /lucee-resin/conf/app-default.xml to verify that the MessageBroker is there. You will find the services-config.xml and the remoting-config.xml in the /lucee-resin/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/flex directory. As with the previous version you will have to start the server at least once so that Lucee creates the WEB-INF directory.

So after starting the server you can verify again that the MessageBroker Servlet is running by requesting <http://localhost:8600/flex2gateway>, if you receive the white page everything is good to go.

### Using BlazeDS with the lucee.war ###

If you have downloaded the lucee.war only, you also have to add the MessageBroker Servlet like we did with the Lucee Express Server version. If you want to follow along, I downloaded and unzipped the lucee-3.1.2.001.war into tomcats webapp directory. This is the same tomcat I used when explaining the basic setup of BlazeDS at the top of this page.

Start tomcat once, so that Lucee will populate the WEB-INF directory. Now again all you have to do is to add the MessageBroker Servlet code, this time the easies one is to add it to the /tomcat/webapps/lucee-3.1.2.001/WEB-INF/web.xml:

```lucee
<servlet>
    <servlet-name>MessageBrokerServlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>flex.messaging.MessageBrokerServlet</servlet-class>
    <init-param>
        <param-name>services.configuration.file</param-name>
        <param-value>/WEB-INF/flex/services-config.xml</param-value>
    </init-param>
    <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
</servlet>

<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>MessageBrokerServlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/flex2gateway/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
```

and restart tomcat. If you now request <http://localhost:8080/lucee-3.1.2.001/flex2gateway> you should again have the white page.

## Running multiple Lucee Webs with BlazeDS ##

As we did in the last example, it is perfectly possible to run independent versions of BlazeDS for different websites. For example in the last example we had a blazesd and a lucee-3.1.2.001 web running under the same tomcat.

But if you want to run multiple Lucee webs on the same Lucee server (with one global sever admin), you need to setup BlazeDS in every web separately and you also have to give it independent messageBrokerId's. BlazeDS will then manage instances of itself for your different Lucee webs. To explain this we will add two new web apps to the Lucee Resin Server example we used above.

Under /lucee-resin/webapps/ add two directories called lucee1 and lucee2, copy the index.cfm files from the /lucee-resin/webapps/ROOT directory into these two new apps and restart the server. Lucee created two new webapps with independent web admins and one overall server admin for you. But if you look at the resin console output, you will recognise that the MessageBroker Servlet crashed with an unavailable exception and that it is already defined with messageBrokerId .

On Resin calling <http://localhost:8600/lucee2/flex2gateway> will already work, but for example on JBoss it is unreliable. So, to avoid the error you have to add web.xml files into both new lucee1 and lucee2 directories. Then add the MessageBrokerServlet to it using an independent messageBrokerId for every web. For example for lucee1 in the /lucee-resin/webapps/lucee1/WEB-INF/web.xml add:

```lucee
<servlet>
    <servlet-name>MessageBrokerServlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>flex.messaging.MessageBrokerServlet</servlet-class>
    <init-param>
        <param-name>services.configuration.file</param-name>
        <param-value>/WEB-INF/flex/services-config.xml</param-value>
    </init-param>
    <init-param>
        <param-name>messageBrokerId</param-name>
        <param-value>rail01messageBroker</param-value>
    </init-param>
    <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
</servlet>

<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>MessageBrokerServlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/flex2gateway/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
```

You actually have to do this for any additional web context you add to a Lucee multi web setup.

In the examples above, I always used the /flex2gateway/* mapping, this is because ColdFusion defines this as the default, but you can use whatever you want. Every Lucee web gets its own set of flex config files which means you can setup different BlazeDS endpoints or even destinations for every web.
