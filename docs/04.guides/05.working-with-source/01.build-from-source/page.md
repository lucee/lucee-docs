# Building 5.x from source #

The following text assumes that you have basic knowledge of how to use git and mvn, if not please first consult the documentation for this tools.

### 1. Before you get started

Before you can start building Lucee from source, you will need a few things installed on your machine:

1. **Java JDK** - since you're going to compile Java code you need the JDK and not just the JRE.  Lucee requires JDK 8 or later in order to compile.  <https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/>

1. **Apache Maven** - the source code contains several build scripts that will automate the build process for you. you will need Maven installed in order to run these build scripts. <http://maven.apache.org/>

1. **Apache Ant** - the source code contains several build scripts that will automate the build process for you. you will need Maven installed in order to run these build scripts. <http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi>

### 2. Get the source code

Lucee's source code is version-controlled with Git, [Lucee GitHub repository](https://github.com/lucee/lucee).

The repository contains a few branches, with the most important ones being "Master" (current release) and "Develop" (alpha and beta releases), currently the main branch for development is the 5.3 branch, so best start there.

So simply clone the 5.3 branch (or fork your own copy) from the git repository to your local drive with the following command:

    git clone -b 5.3 https://github.com/lucee/Lucee.git

### 3. Build it

To run the test suite using Maven:

    cd loader
    mvn test

To build the server using Maven:

    cd loader
    mvn clean install

To build the server using Ant:

    cd loader
    ant

To build the server using Ant but without running the test suite:

    cd loader
    ant fast

### 4. Deploy

TBD
