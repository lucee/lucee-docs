## **Setting up multiple Lucee websites on Windows/IIS:** ##

These instructions assume you know how to set up DNS, port forwarding for your router, and how to add a new site in IIS.

1) Install Lucee [[https://lucee.org/downloads.html]]

2) Verify that Lucee is running (The internal IP of my Lucee server is 192.168.1.80, so I went to <http://192.168.1.80:8888> to view the Hello Lucee page, which verified a successful deployment)

3) Set up DNS for a site, if you haven't already (I added `lctest.blahblah.com` to my GoDaddy DNS). Set up port forwarding on your router, if needed. Add your new site to IIS.

4) Create your local folder, if you haven't already ( I used `C:\sites\lctest`)

5) Add a Host entry to `Server.XML` - I installed to the default location (`C:\lucee`) so the path is `C:\lucee\tomcat\conf\server.xml`)

6) Just above the `</Engine>` tag, add the following Host entry:

```
<Host name="lctest.blahblah.com" appBase="webapps"
	unpackWARs="true" autoDeploy="true"
	xmlValidation="false" xmlNamespaceAware="false">
	<Context path="" docBase="C:\sites\lctest\" />
	<Alias>lctest.blahblah.com</Alias>
</Host>
```

Substitute your host name and alias, and put in your local folder for docBase

7) Save the XML file and Restart Lucee - in Windows 2012 R2, click the Start button, click the down arrow, select Lucee-Tomcat Service Control.

8) On the General tab, click the Stop button. When Service Status changes to Stopped, click the Start button.

9) Create a simple index.cfm file - if you're stumped, you can use the example code from Tom Kitta's tutorial - <http://www.tomkitta.com/guides/cf_101.cfm>

10) Navigate to your alias - for me, it was http://]lctest.blahblah.com - and check that index.cfm executes

The same principles apply for migrating existing sites to a new Lucee server, after setting up any necessary datasources and, if needed, SMTP server.

## **Enabling Debugging on multiple Lucee websites** ##

Create a web.config file in the site's root folder. It should contain:

```
<configuration>
   <system.webServer>
      <httpErrors errorMode="Detailed" />
   </system.webServer>
</configuration>
```

Here is a quick way to get a dump to make sure debug works (add to your `index.cfm` file):

`<cfdump var="#{ URL: URL, variables: variables, CGI: CGI }#">`
