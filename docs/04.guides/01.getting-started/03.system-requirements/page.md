## **System Requirements:** ##

The basic requirement for running Lucee is a servlet engine. So basically if a servlet engine is available for your system, Lucee will most probably run on it. It even runs on a RaspberryPi.

Of course there are different recommendations that go with the different operating systems. Here are general guidelines for each OS.

### Java Versions ###

Lucee 5.4 (LTS) supports Java 8 and 11

Lucee 6 supports Java 11, with Java 8 unofficially supported as long as practical 

Lucee 6.1 supports Java 11 and Java 21 (recommended)

Lucee 6.2 will support both the Javax and Jakarta Namespaces, thus supporting Tomcat 10 etc

If you do run into problems running on **newer versions** of Java with Lucee 6, please report any problems to the developer forum [Lucee Dev](https://dev.lucee.org)
