#Lucee 5

Lucee 5 is the first major release after forking from the Railo project. Lucee 5 is not about dazzling new features but about improving the core language and providing a complete architectural overhaul of the engine.

This brings Lucee and CFML to a whole new level!

## Language Enhancements ##
Lucee 5 provides the following core language enhancements:

* [[lucee-5-abstract-final]] - Lucee already supports interfaces, but interfaces have not been well adopted by the community, because they are only used to do "sign a contract" when you implement them. Abstract and Final modifiers are a much more intuitive and flexible way to do the same and even more.

* [[lucee-5-access=modifiers]] - Lucee already supports access modifiers for functions, but with Lucee 4 this was limited to functions, Lucee 5 now also supports the same for variables.

* [[lucee-5-component-static]] - Lucee 5 supports static variables and functions inside components.

* [[lucee-5-lambda]] - Lucee 5 support Lambda Expression alongside closures, a shorthand notation for anonymous functions.

* [[lucee-5-functions-tags]] - New and modified functions in Lucee 5.

* [[lucee-5-tags]] - New and modified tags in Lucee 5.

* [[lucee-5-cached-within]] - We not only added the attribute `cachedWithin` to the tag `cffile` and `cfhttp`, we have also added an interface to Lucee to make your own `cachedwithin` implementation.

* [[lucee-5-unquoted-arguments]]

* [[lucee-5-java-interface]] - (TODO) - Lucee provides a interface to interact with Lucee from within Java, Lucee 5 has extended this interface with a lot of new functionality, which makes it far easier to write Extensions for Lucee.

## Architecture Enhancements ##
Lucee 5 has had a complete overhaul under the hood, we have not only redone a lot of the existing functionality, we have also extended the interfaces to the engine to make way for a lot of possible functionality in the future.

* [[lucee-5-osgi]] - Lucee 5 is completely [OSGi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSGi) based, OSGi is the defacto standard in most Java enterprise environments, to manage bundles (jar libraries) used by the environment.

* Scripting (JSR 223) - Lucee 5 fully supports the [Java Scripting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_for_the_Java_Platform) standard. Java scripting allows to use Lucee in places you could not dream before. As an Example, we use this interface to use Lucee within ANT, so we run for example our CFML testcases within ANT as part of the build process and of course the CFML code has full accesson the ANT enviroment.

* [[lucee-5-class-updating]] - Previously an optional feature in Lucee 4, class updating is now an integral part of Lucee 5. Lucee 5 is able to update existing classes and this has a huge impact on memory consumption, especially in environments where a lot of CFML templates are used and this no longer need any configuration, Lucee does this automatically.

* Modularity - CFML is coming a long way and on that way it has collected a lot of very useful functionality, but every functionality you are not using is simply a burden to carry around. So with Lucee 5 we decided to move a lot of functionality out of the core to extensions, all this Extensions are installed by default, so you have the same experience as you had before out of the box. But now you can simply uninstall what you not use to lighten up Lucee. Things that have moved to Extensions are: Hibernate (ORM), Lucene (Search), all Datasource drivers, S3 Resource, PDF/Document tags, Chart tags and we just have started on this.

* Bytecode Handling - We have improved the generated Java Bytecode produced in general by optimizing it for Java >=7 and we have done specific improvements of the generated bytecode in multiple places.

## Extensions ##
Lucee 5 has had a complete overhaul of the existing extension framework, to make it easier for anyone to create an extension. See [[lucee-5-extensions]]

## Install/Upgrade instructions ##
* Fresh install - We provide various possibilities to install Lucee in different ways, simply download your favorite package from [[http://download.lucee.org]].
* [[lucee-5-upgrading-lucee-45]] - Update from Lucee is as simple as replacing a single file, but you can do a little bit more to have a clean system.
