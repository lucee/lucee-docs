At the time of this writing : mod_cfml is at v1.1.05, Boncode AJP connector is at v1.0.32, Tomcat is at v8.5.6

**Please note : These instrutions were written for Windows Server 2016 (64 bit)**

Download & Install mod_cfml Tomcat Valve
========================================
mod_cfml dynamically creates hosts in Tomcat based on the request headers of the incoming request.

* Download the latest mod_cfml JAR file from http://www.modcfml.org/index.cfm/downloads/
* copy the .JAR file to  "C:\Program Files\Tomcat\lib\"
* Restart the Tomcat service

Download & Install Boncode AJP 1.3 Connector
============================================
BonCode AJP (Apache JServ Protocol version 1.3) Connector is used connect the IIS web server to the Apache Tomcat server.

### Boncode AJP 1.3 Connector Prerequisites ###
ASP dot NET Framework version 3.51 or higher must be installed

## Automatic Install of Boncode AJP connector with default settings ##
For the purposes of simplcity, do an automatic install of the Boncode AJP 1.3 connector with the default settings.

* Download the Boncode AJP connector from http://www.boncode.net/boncode-connector
* Extract the .zip file into a temporary directory
* Launch Connector_Setup.exe
* Accept defaults for each installation option

### Edit BonCodeAJP13.settings file ###

On windows 2016 with a default install of Boncode, the location of BonCodeAJP13.settings file is "C:\Windows\BonCodeAJP13.settings".

Previous versions of Windows may place this file in "C:\Windows\System32\BonCodeAJP13.settings"

* Launch your favorite text editor **as a local Administrator** and open BonCodeAJP13.settings
* Add the following items just before the closing `</Settings>` tag
```
<EnableHeaderDataSupport>True</EnableHeaderDataSupport>
<ModCFMLSecret>secret key also set in the Apache/IIS config</ModCFMLSecret>
```
* Replace the secret key value  ('secret key also set in the Apache/IIS config') with a random secure key.  If you need help creating one, you can generate a reasonably secure unique key here https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm
* Save the BonCodeAJP13.settings file **(Note: If you did not open your text editor as an Administrator, you may not be able to overwrite the existing file due to NTFS permissions)**

### Edit Tomcat server.xml file ###

If you followed the instructions on the previous pages, the Tomcat server.xml file should be in "D:\Tomcat\conf\server.xml"

On a default Tomcat install, the Tomcat server.xml file should be in "C:\Program Files\Tomcat\conf\server.xml" and you may need to edit the file

* Launch your favorite text editor **as a local Administrator** and open the Tomcat server.xml file.
* Locate the Host section near the end of the configuration which reads `<Host name="localhost"...`
* Add the following code block before the closing `</Host>` tag.
```
    <Valve className="mod_cfml.core"
		   loggingEnabled="false"
		   maxContexts="100"
		   timeBetweenContexts="0"
		   scanClassPaths="false"
		   sharedKey="secret key also set in the Apache/IIS config" />
```
* Replace the secret key value  ('secret key also set in the Apache/IIS config') with the same key you used in the BonCodeAJP13.settings file above.
* Restart the Tomcat service

### Optional - relocating WEB-INF files outside the web root ###
By default, Lucee places its web-context configuration and data files in a folder named WEB-INF within the web root of each IIS site.
The WEB-INF folder structure gets created automatically when Lucee gets called to serve up a .cfm/.cfml file.
If you wish to redirect the web-context data elsewhere, follow the instructions below.


If you followed the instructions on previous pages, you already have a folder called D:\Lucee\.  Create a subfolder called "web-contexts" within D:\Lucee\

* Launch your favorite text editor **as a local Administrator** and open _D:\Tomcat\conf\web.xml_
* Locate the section near the end of the configuration which reads '<servlet-name>CFMLServlet</servlet-name>'
* Locate the '<init-param>' section which contains '<param-name>lucee-web-directory</param-name>'
* Replace the '<param-value>' with _D:\Lucee\web-contexts\{web-context-label}_
* Restart the Tomcat service
