### Securing /WEB-INF/ by moving it outside of the web root ###

By default, Lucee places its web-context configuration and data files in a folder named WEB-INF within the web root of each website.
The WEB-INF folder structure gets created automatically when Lucee gets called to serve up a .cfm/.cfml file.
If you wish to redirect the web-context data elsewhere, follow the instructions below.

If you followed the instructions on previous pages, you already have a folder called D:\Lucee\.  Create a subfolder called "web-contexts" within D:\Lucee\

* Launch your favorite text editor **as a local Administrator** and open _D:\Tomcat\conf\web.xml_
* Locate the section near the end of the configuration which reads '<servlet-name>CFMLServlet</servlet-name>'
* Locate the '<init-param>' section which contains '<param-name>lucee-web-directory</param-name>'
* Replace the '<param-value>' with _D:\Lucee\web-contexts\{web-context-label}_
* Restart the Tomcat service
