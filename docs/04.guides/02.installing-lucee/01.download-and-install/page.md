# Download and Install Lucee Server #

Lucee can be installed and run almost everywhere that is capable of running a [supported Java Version](/guides/installing-lucee/download-and-install.html#supportedJavaVersions). You can even run Lucee on a small RasberryPI. Because of it's great flexibility, Lucee Server comes in different flavors to match your needs (Lucee Express, Lucee Installer, CommandBox, Lucee.jar/Lucee.war). This document will help you decide which one fits best for your purpose.

				<strong>Lucee Express</strong> allows you to quickly test Lucee without installing. This version runs Lucee in a lightweight and portable manner. It doesn't install Java Development Kit (JDK), services nor connectors or other files that are typically installed in a production environment. Lucee Express also ships Tomcat with fewer binaries/scripts.  By default the <strong>Lucee Express</strong> listens on port 8888 (e.g. http://localhost:8888).

			    To run Lucee Express you still need to have a Java Development Kit (e.g. <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html" target="_blank">AdoptOpenJDK</a>) pre installed on your OS. If you don't want to install a JDK on your OS and instead run Lucee Express with its own dedicated JDK version, you can set the JRE_HOME environment variable pointing to that specific JDK version by using Tomcats <em>path-to-lucee-express\bin\setenv.bat (Windows) or path-to-lucee-express/bin/setenv.sh (Linux)</em> as follows:<br><br>
				<strong>Step 1:</strong> Download the latest Java Development Kit, e.g. <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html" target="_blank">AdoptOpenJDK</a> as ZIP-Version for your OS and unzip it.<br> 
				<strong>Step 2:</strong> For <strong>Windows:</strong> Create a batch file at  <em>path-to-lucee-express\bin\setenv.bat</em> with the following content:

<pre>
REM set a path to a dedicated JDK 
set "JRE_HOME=path-to-your-jdk\"
exit /b 0
</pre>

For <strong>Linux/MacOS:</strong> Create a shell script at  <em>path-to-lucee-express\bin\setenv.sh</em> with the following content:

<pre>
# Set set a path to a dedicated JDK 
JRE_HOME=/path-to-your-jdk/
CATALINA_PID="$CATALINA_BASE/tomcat.pid"
</pre>

<strong>Step 3:</strong> To run Lucee Express execute <em>path-to-lucee-express\bin\startup.bat</em> (Windows) or <em>path-to-lucee-express/bin/startup.sh</em> (Linux or Mac).<br>

			  If you are missing the latest "Lucee Installer" Release at Lucee's download site and it's marked as "Coming soon", you can still install the latest available Lucee version with the following steps:<br>

				<strong>Step 2:</strong> Stop the Lucee/Tomcat service.<br>
				<strong>Step 3:</strong> Download the latest "Lucee.jar" file at Lucee's download page <a href="https://lucee.org/downloads.html">here</a>.<br>
				<strong>Step 4:</strong> Replace the old lucee.jar with the new downloaded Lucee.jar file at <em>path-to-lucee-install/lib/</em>.<br>
				<strong>Step 5:</strong> Delete the folder "lucee-server" at <em>path-to-lucee-install/tomcat/lucee-server</em>.<br>

				<strong>CommandBox</strong> is a commandline tool that greatly simplifies installing and running Lucee. It's very likely the easiest way to run Lucee: Simply open a terminal session from within your webroot, enter the command line 'box server start' and CommandBox will start the latest stable Lucee instance running your web application.<br>
                CommandBox makes use of it's 
				own servlet engine "Undertow" that can be customized through a single .json configuration file. But that's not all you get with CommandBox: Because CommandBox is also a package manager, you can also install and run usefool tools for your CFML development, such as "cfconfig", "CFLint", "taskRunner", "testBox", "CFFormat" or use it to install popular CFML frameworks in a modern scaffolding manner.

### The difference between "Snapshots", "Release Candidates (RC)" and "Stable Releases" of Lucee downloads ###

At [https://download.lucee.org](https://download.lucee.org) you will find the downloads categorized as "Releases" for Stable Releases, "RC" for Release Candidates, and "Snapshots". These file names are a reference to Lucee's continuous integration workflow.

The Lucee development team is constantly making changes to the Lucee source code. These changes are released almost daily and called **Snapshots**. This gives Lucee developers the ability to quickly get a "Snapshot" of Lucee in its development timeline.

Once the Lucee code reaches a certain level of maturity in its development cycle, a corresponding snapshot is carefully selected and also published as a **Release Candidate (RC)** for broad testing. This is the phase where the Lucee development team focuses on fixing new regressions with the highest priority.

Once the new bugs and regressions are fixed, a stable snapshot is selected and released as a **Stable Release**.

<a name="supportedJavaVersions"></a>

### Java Versions Supported ###

- The Official Lucee Installer comes with Java 11, which is our recommended version
- Java 8 is still officially supported for 5.3, with Lucee 6 it will be no longer officially supported, but will be unofficially, as long as feasible
- Lucee Supports Java 9 since version 5.3.0.57
- Java 16 is not currently supported due to breaking internal changes with the jvm, [LDEV-3526](https://luceeserver.atlassian.net/browse/LDEV-3526)

### Java Support tips ###

- When reporting a bug with Lucee, **please always describe your stack** (Lucee version, Java Version, Tomcat/etc version and the Extension version, if it's extension related)
- If you aren't running the latest release of Java and encounter a problem, please try updating your Java version before reporting a bug, especially if it's several years old!

### Using Lucee with multiple websites, mod_cfml ###

Lucee doesn't support multiple webserver hosts directly, however [mod_cfml](https://viviotech.github.io/mod_cfml/index.html) is available to achieve this. Mod_cfml is capable to identify new CFML web applications on the fronted webservers side, such as IIS on Windows or Apache on Linux, and automatically add the necessary configuration to your Lucee/Tomcat configuration.

<a name="BoncodeAJP"></a>

### Boncode AJP Connector ###

To connect Microsofts Internet Information Services (IIS) with Lucee/Tomcat the Lucee Installer uses the Boncode connector using Apache JServ Protocol (AJP). For further information about Boncode AJP, FAQs and troubleshooting, please refer to [Boncode AJP Documentation](http://www.boncode.net/boncode-connector)
