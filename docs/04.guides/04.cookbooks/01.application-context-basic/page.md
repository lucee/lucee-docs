# Application.cfc #

The Application.cfc is a component you put in your web application that then is picked up by Lucee as part of the request.
The Application.cfc is used to define context specific configurations/settings and event driven functions.
Your website can have multiple Application.cfc files, every single file then defines an independent application context.

Let's say you have a website that has a shop under the path "/shop" that needs user sessions, but the rest of the website does not.
In that case you could define an Application.cfc at "/shop" that has session handling enabled and one in the webroot that has not.

## Location, Location, Location ##

With the default setting Lucee always picks the "nearest" Application.cfc, so it searches from the current location down to the webroot.
This is only one possible behavior of many, Lucee gives you the possibility in the Lucee Administrator under "Settings / Request" to decide where Lucee looks for the Application.cfc and if it looks at all.

![search mode](https://bitbucket.org/repo/rX87Rq/images/3223743265-APP-SEARCH-MODE.png)

So, for example, if you only have one Application.cfc in the webroot, define "Root" as setting.

## Functions ##

The Application.cfc supports multiple event driven functions, what does this mean?
You can define functions inside the Application.cfc that are called when certain events happen.

### OnApplicationStart ###

This function is triggered when no application context exists for this Application.cfc, so normally when the first request on this application context is made.

```cfs
component {
   boolean function onApplicationStart() {
      application.whatever=new Whatever(); // init whatever
   }
}
```

This is normally used to initialize the environment for your application, so for example load data/objects and store them in the application scope.
if the function returns false or throws an exception, the application context is not initialized and the next request will call "onApplicationStart" again. "onApplicationStart" is thread safe.

### OnApplicationEnd ###

The opposite from "onApplicationStart", this function is triggered when the application context ends, means when the timeout of the application context is reached (this.applicationTimeout).

```cfs
component {
   void function onApplicationEnd(struct application) {
      arguments.application.whatever.finalize();
   }
}
```

This is normally used to finalize the environment of your application, so for example unload data/objects.
You receive the application scope that ends as an argument to the function.

### OnSessionStart ###

This function is triggered with every request that has no session defined in the current application context.

```cfs
component {
   void function onSessionStart() {
      session.whatever=new Whatever(session.cfid); // init whatever
   }
}
```

This is normally used to initialize the environment for a specific session, so for example load data/objects and store them in the session scope.

### OnSessionEnd ###

The opposite from "onSessionStart", this function is triggered when a specific session context ends, when the timeout of a session context is reached (this.sessionTimeout).

```cfs
component {
   void function onSessionEnd(struct session,struct application) {
      arguments.session.whatever.finalize();
   }
}
```

This is normally used to finalize the environment of your application, so for example unload data/objects.
You receive the related application scope and the session scope that ends, as arguments to the function.

### OnRequestStart ###

This function is triggered before every request, so you can prepare the environment for the request, for example to produce the HTML header or load some data/objects used within the request.

```cfs
component {
   boolean function onRequestStart(string targetPage) {
       echo('<html><head><body>'); // outputs the response html header
       request.whatever=new Whatever(); // prepare an object to use within the request
       return true;
   }
}
```

If the function returns false, Lucee stops any further execution of this request and return the result to the client.

### OnRequestEnd ###

This function is triggered after every request, so you can cleanup the environment after the request, for example produce the HTML footer or unload some data/objects used within the request.

```cfs
component {
   void function onRequestEnd(string targetPage) {
       echo('</body></html>'); // outputs the response html footer
       request.whatever.finalize();
   }
}
```

### OnRequest ###

If this function exists, Lucee only executes this function and no longer looks for the "targetPage" defined with the request.
So let's say you have the call "/index.cfm", if there is an "/index.cfm" in the file system or not, does not matter, it is not executed anyway.

**Other CFML Engines will complain when the called target page does not exist physically even it is never used!**

```cfs
component {
   void function onRequest(string targetPage) {
       echo('<html><body>Hello World</body></html>');
   }
}
```

### OnCFCRequest ###

Similar to "onRequest", but this function is used to handle remote component calls (HTTP Webservices).

```cfs
component {
   void function onCFCRequest(string cfcName, string methodName, struct args) {
       echo('<html><body>Hello World</body></html>');
   }
}
```

### OnError ###

This method is triggered when an uncaught exception occurs in this application context.

```cfs
component {
   void function onError(struct exception, string eventName) {
       dump(var:exception,label:eventName);
   }
}
```

As arguments you receive the exception (cfcatch block) and the eventName.

### OnAbort ###

This method is triggered when a request is ended with help of the tag <cfabort>.

```cfs
component {
   void function onAbort(string targetPage) {
       dump("request "&targetPage&" ended with an abort!");
   }
}
```

### OnDebug ###

This method is triggered when debugging is enabled for this request.

```cfs
component {
   void function onDebug(struct debuggingData) {
       dump(var:debuggingData,label:"debug information");
   }
}
```

### OnMissingTemplate ###

This method is triggered when a requested page was not found and **no function "onRequest" is defined **.

```cfs
component {
   void function onMissingTemplate(string targetPage) {
       echo("missing:"&targetPage);
   }
}
```
