# How to update an existing installation #

To update an existing Lucee Installation go to "Services/Update" in your Lucee Server Administrator.

If a patch is available, Lucee will display a box detailing the changes made in this and all intermediate patches. Simply click the "execute update" button to patch your current version.

## Update Providers ##

Lucee comes with different update providers for stable, preview or development (Bleeding Edge) releases. You can even define a custom update provider for your builds!

Simply choose one of the listed update providers or add your own. Lucee will then list the patches available from that update provider.

## Updating the first release (4.5.0.042) ##

Unfortunately the first Lucee release cannot be updated from within the Lucee Administrator and needs to be updated manually as follows:

1. Download the "lucee.jar" from the [Lucee downloads page](http://stable.lucee.org/download/?type=releases).
2. Stop your Lucee Server (the Servlet Engine).
3. Replace the existing lucee.jar, with the downloaded version.
4. Restart your Lucee Server.

## Firewall ##

Updating via the Administrator may not work if you are behind a firewall, in which case simply follow the instructions below:

1. Download the latest ".lco" file from the [Lucee downloads page](http://stable.lucee.org/download/?type=releases).
2. Stop your Lucee Server
3. Copy the downloaded file to "{server-context}/patches" (the server context is normally at "{Lucee-Server}/lib/ext/lucee-server/patches").
3. Restart Lucee.
