# Monitoring/Debugging

Lucee 6.1 changed how you handle Monitoring/Debugging.

## Old Behaviour

Previously, you could enable/disable Debugging in the Lucee admin, and enable/disable specific debug options like showing template execution. With the tag `<cfsetting showDebugOutput="true|false">`, you could define whether the debugging is shown or not.

## New Behaviour

Lucee 6 has completely overhauled this functionality. Instead of having "Metrics" and "Reference" as part of the "Modern" Debug Template, they are now independently controlled under the new umbrella term "Monitoring".

### Lucee Admin

The "debugging" settings are now under the group "Monitoring" and there is a new page called "Output".

#### Page "Output"

On the "Output" page, you define which sections of monitoring are shown:

- Debugging
- Metrics
- Documentation (formerly "Reference")
- Test (available soon)

This is similar to the action `<cfsetting showOutput="true|false">` (more on that tag later).

#### Page "Settings"

You no longer enable/disable debug as a whole, only the options. If no options are enabled, debugging is disabled. Thus, the general switch was/is not really needed anymore.

#### Page "Debug Templates"

Here you can choose the debug template you want to use. You can limit it to a specific IP Range if you like, and you can also define different templates for different IP Ranges, though one template can cover all requests.

#### Page "Logs"

This page allows you to show the last X requests (depending on your settings), which is useful if no debugging is shown on the output.

### Application.cfc

Lucee 6.1 now allows you to overwrite all these settings in the Application.cfc, which was not possible in previous versions.

You can define what is shown:

```lucee
this.monitoring.showDebug = true;
this.monitoring.showDoc = true;
this.monitoring.showMetric = true;
this.monitoring.showTest = true; // following soon
```

And also enable/disable debug options:

```lucee
this.monitoring.debuggingTemplate = true;
this.monitoring.debuggingDatabase = true;
this.monitoring.debuggingException = true;
this.monitoring.debuggingTracing = true;
this.monitoring.debuggingDump = true;
this.monitoring.debuggingTimer = true;
this.monitoring.debuggingImplicitAccess = true;
this.monitoring.debuggingThread = true;
```

You can also export all these settings in the Lucee Administrator on the Monitoring/Settings page.

### In Your Code

Even after the Application.cfc, you can still change these settings.

With the help of the tag `<cfapplication>`:

```lucee
<cfapplication
    action="update"
    showDebug="false"
    showDoc="true"
    showMetric="false"
    showTest="false"
    debuggingTemplate="false"
    debuggingDatabase="true">
```

Or with the tag `<cfsetting>` you can change the "show" settings (not the debug options):

```lucee
<cfsetting
    showDebug="false"
    showDoc="true"
    showMetric="false"
    showTest="false">
```

#### Downside/Upside

Of course, when you enable, for example, "debuggingTemplate" in your code, everything that happened before was not logged and is lost. But this can also be a benefit, as it allows you to do things like this:

```lucee
try {
    application action="update" debuggingTemplate=false;
    include "mysecretcode.cfm";
} finally {
    application action="update" debuggingTemplate=true;
}
```

This way, you can prevent Lucee from logging certain code.

## Tab Documentation (formerly Reference)

This tab now not only gives you a function and tag reference, it also provides all kinds of "recipes" like this.

## Backward Compatibility

These new features are fully backward compatible.

### Tag cfsetting

The old attribute "showDebugOutput" is now an alias to the newly introduced "show" attribute. This means with this attribute you can still enable/disable Monitoring as a whole.

So when you do:

```lucee
<cfsetting showDebugOutput="false">
```

It will not show the monitoring at all, the same way as you would do:

```lucee
<cfsetting show="false">
```

## Conclusion

Lucee 6.1 gives you full control over Monitoring in your code, making it easier for every developer to use it.
