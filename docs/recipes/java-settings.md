# Java Settings in Application.cfc (Now with Maven Support)

This document provides information about configuring Java settings in Lucee using `Application.cfc`, and other new places like `.CFConfig.json`, `createObject`, and components.

## Introduction

The `this.javasettings` settings in `Application.cfc` allow you to define Java library paths, OSGi bundle paths, Maven libraries, and other Java-related configurations. These settings cannot be configured through the Lucee admin or environment variables.

Starting with Lucee 6.2, weâ€™ve extended Java settings to support Maven libraries and expanded their use in additional contexts, including `.CFConfig.json`, `createObject`, and individual components.

## Configuring Java Settings

You can configure Java settings in `Application.cfc`, `.CFConfig.json`, within components, or using the `createObject` function.

### Load Paths

You can define regular JARs (not OSGi) by specifying the path to a directory or the JAR file itself.

```cfml
this.javasettings.loadPaths = [
    "/my/local/path/to/whatever/lib/",
    "/my/local/path/to/whatever/lib/xyz.jar"
];
```

### Bundle Paths

You can load local OSGi bundles in a similar way.

```cfml
this.javasettings.bundlePaths = [
    "/my/local/path/to/whatever/lib/",
    "/my/local/path/to/whatever/lib/xyz.jar"
];
```

### Maven Support

Starting in Lucee 6.2, Maven support has been added to `this.javasettings`, allowing you to define Maven dependencies directly. Maven manages libraries by automatically handling their retrieval and versioning.

```cfml
this.javasettings.maven = [
    {
      "groupId": "org.quartz-scheduler",
      "artifactId": "quartz",
      "version": "2.3.2"
    },
    {
      "groupId": "commons-beanutils",
      "artifactId": "commons-beanutils",
      "version": "1.9.4"
    }
];
```

If the `version` is omitted, Lucee will use the latest available version of the Maven artifact.

## Java Settings in `.CFConfig.json`

You can also define Java settings globally for all applications through the `.CFConfig.json` configuration file. This is especially useful when managing Docker environments.

```json
{
  "javasettings": {
    "maven": [
      {
        "groupId": "org.quartz-scheduler",
        "artifactId": "quartz",
        "version": "2.3.2"
      },
      {
        "groupId": "commons-beanutils",
        "artifactId": "commons-beanutils",
        "version": "1.9.4"
      }
    ],
    "loadPaths": [
      "/my/local/path/to/whatever/lib/",
      "/my/local/path/to/whatever/lib/xyz.jar"
    ],
    "bundlePaths": [
      "/my/local/path/to/whatever/lib/",
      "/my/local/path/to/whatever/lib/xyz.jar"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Using Java Settings in `Application.cfc`

In your [[tag-Application]], you can define or override Java settings specific to your application.

This is the primary way to configure Java dependencies at the application level.

```cfml
this.javasettings = {
  "maven": [
    {
      "groupid": "commons-beanutils",
      "artifactid": "commons-beanutils",
      "version": "1.9.4"
    }
  ],
  "loadPaths": [
    "/my/local/path/to/libs/",
    "/my/local/path/to/libs/example.jar"
  ],
  "bundlePaths": [
    "/my/local/path/to/bundles/"
  ],
  "reloadOnChange": true,
  "watchInterval": 60,
  "watchExtensions": ["jar", "class"]
};
```

This method gives you flexibility to handle specific Java dependencies within each application, ensuring that classloaders are configured per application.

### Using Java Settings in a Component

Maven dependencies and other Java settings can also be defined as part of a [[tag-component]].

This ensures that only the classes loaded within that component will use the specified settings, isolating it from the rest of the application and avoiding conflicts.

```cfml
component javaSettings = '{
  "maven": [
    {
      "groupId": "commons-beanutils",
      "artifactId": "commons-beanutils",
      "version": "1.9.4"
    }
  ]
}' {
  // Component logic
}
```

This method is useful for encapsulating components with specific versions of libraries, preventing conflicts with other parts of the application.

### Using Java Settings in `createObject`

Java settings can also be defined dynamically when creating Java objects using the [[function-createObject]] function.

```cfml
createObject("java", "org.apache.commons.beanutils.BeanUtils", {
  "maven": [
    {
      "groupId": "commons-beanutils",
      "artifactId": "commons-beanutils",
      "version": "1.9.4"
    }
  ]
});
```

This approach provides the flexibility to load Java classes and dependencies at runtime.

## Classloader Recycling

Lucee automatically generates a unique hash based on the defined Java settings and maintains a pool of corresponding classloaders. This means that classloaders are reused efficiently, reducing resource consumption and improving performance.

## Reload On Change

The setting `this.javasettings.reloadOnChange` indicates whether to reload updated classes and JARs dynamically, without restarting Lucee. The default value is `false`.

```cfml
this.javasettings.reloadOnChange = false;
```

## Watch Interval

The setting `this.javasettings.watchInterval` defines the interval in seconds that Lucee looks for changes. The default value is `60`.

```cfml
this.javasettings.watchInterval = 60;
```

## Watch Extensions

The setting `this.javasettings.watchExtensions` defines the extensions Lucee looks for when you list a directory with `loadPaths` or `bundlePaths`. The default value is `["jar", "class"]`.

```cfml
this.javasettings.watchExtensions = ["jar", "class"];
```

## Conclusion

With the introduction of Maven support and the ability to define Java settings in multiple contexts such as `.CFConfig.json`, `Application.cfc`, components, and `createObject`, Lucee provides enhanced flexibility for integrating and managing Java libraries. These features help avoid conflicts and ensure that your Java dependencies are managed efficiently across various parts of your application.
