# Looping Through File

This document explains how to handle big files in Lucee in a better way. The classic way that you are familiar with uses cffile tag, fileRead, and fileReadBinary functions to read the file into memory. This is a simple solution, but it consumes a lot of memory.

## Example: Handle files with cffile tag, fileRead, and fileReadBinary functions

```luceescript
include "_getPath2BigFile.cfm";
NL="";
// read the complete file into memory
content=fileRead(path);
// now we split, again everything lands in memory as an array
arr=listToArray(content,NL);
// now we loop over every single line
loop array=arr index="i" item="line" {
	handle(line);
}
function handle(line) {}
dump(label:"String Size",var:len(content));
dump(label:"Array Size",var:len(arr));
```

In the example above,

- Read the file into the memory
- Split into array
- Loop over the array

It consumes a lot of memory.

## Use Loop - File

Use cfloop file. It allows you to read a file line by line, so you do not have to load an entire file into memory. You only load a line at a time into the memory.

```luceescript
<cfloop file="...">
```

## Example Using Loop

```luceescript
include "_getPath2BigFile.cfm";
// now we loop over every single line
loop file=path item="line" {
	handle(line);
}
function handle(line) {}
```

In the above example, loop through the file and get each line, so in memory there is only ever the one line. This is not only faster, it also consumes less memory.
