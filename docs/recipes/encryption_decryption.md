# Encryption/Decryption

This document explains about Encryption/Decryption with public and private keys with simple examples.

Encryption/Decryption is a new functionality in Lucee 5.3. We have a new way to encrypt/decrypt string values. First we start with keys. In this case, there are two keys:

- Private key to encrypt
- Public key to decrypt

## Example 1:

```luceescript
//index.cfm
directory action="list" directory=getDirectoryFromPath(getCurrentTemplatePath()) filter="example*.cfm" name="dir";
loop query=dir {
	echo('<a href="#dir.name#">#dir.name#</a><br>');
}
```

```luceescript
key=generateRSAKeys();
dump(key)
```

This function generates RSA keys. Execute the example code above in the browser and a struct is returned containing the two keys: a private key and a public key. So, we can create these keys, and store them somewhere for later use.

## Example 2:

```luceescript
key=generateRSAKeys();
raw="Hi, Hello !!!";
enc=encrypt(raw,key.private,"rsa");
dump(enc);
```

We now create RSA keys using the [[function-generatersakeys]] function, and then use the key to encrypt using the [[function-encrypt]] function. The encrypt() function has some arguments. It has `key.private` which defines the key as the private key, and `rsa` indicates use of the RSA encryption algorithm. Then run the dump in the browser and we see the encrypted string for your input string.

## Example 3:

```luceescript
key=generateRSAKeys();
raw="Hi, Hello !!!";
enc=encrypt(raw,key.private,"rsa");
dec=decrypt(enc,key.public,"rsa");
dump(dec);
```

This is a full detailed example of encrypt/decrypt functions. We create a key and we encrypt with the private key. Then we [[function-decrypt]] with the public key. Then run the dump in the browser and we see the original string returned as expected.
