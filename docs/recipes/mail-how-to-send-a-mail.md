# Mail - How to send a Mail

The following example shows you how you can send a mail. Before you can use this functionality, you have to define a Mail server in the Lucee Administrator.

## Tags

```coldfusion
<cfmail subject="Your Order" from="whatever@lucee.org" to="whatever@gmail.com">
  Hi there,
  This mail is sent to confirm that we have received your order.
</cfmail>
```

## Script

```cfs
mail subject="Your Order" from="whatever@lucee.org" to="whatever@gmail.com" {
  writeOutput('Hi there,');
  writeOutput('This mail is sent to confirm that we have received your order.');
};
```

That is all you need to do to send a mail.
