# Mail - How to send a Mail

The following example shows you how you can send a mail using [[tag-mail]].

In order to send and email, you need to provide the mail server configuration.

- Define a default Mail server in the Lucee Administrator / `CFConfig.json`
- Configure an application specific mail server in [[tag-application]]
- Pass the server details directly using [[tag-mail]] attributes, `server`, `port` etc

## Tags

```coldfusion
<cfmail subject="Your Order" from="whatever@lucee.org" to="whatever@gmail.com">
  Hi there,
  This mail is sent to confirm that we have received your order.
</cfmail>
```

## Script

```cfs
mail subject="Your Order" from="whatever@lucee.org" to="whatever@gmail.com" {
  writeOutput('Hi there,');
  writeOutput('This mail is sent to confirm that we have received your order.');
};
```

That is all you need to do to send a mail.

## Spooling

By default Lucee spools mails and sends them out via a background thread, for better performance.

If you need to send the mail immediately, or need catch any SMTP errors, use `async="false"` which will send the email immediately and throw an errors encountered which will otherwise be caught and logged to the `remoteclient.log`

```cfs
mail subject="Your Order" from="whatever@lucee.org" to="whatever@gmail.com" async="false" {
  writeOutput('Hi there,');
  writeOutput('This mail is sent to confirm that we have received your order.');
};
```
