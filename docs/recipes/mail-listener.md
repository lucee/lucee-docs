# Mail Listeners

Since Lucee 6.0, you can define a listener in the Application.cfc to listen to or manipulate every mail executed.

## Global Listeners

This example shows how to define a global mail listener in the Application.cfc:

```lucee
this.mail.listener = {
    before: function (caller, nextExecution, created, detail, closed, advanced, tries, id, type, remainingtries) {
        detail.from &= ".de";
        return arguments.detail;
    },
    after: function (caller, created, detail, closed, lastExecution, advanced, tries, id, type, passed, remainingtries) {
        systemOutput(arguments.keyList(), 1, 1);
    }
}
```

The listener can also be a component:

```lucee
this.mail.listener = new MailListener();
```

The component would look like this:

```lucee
component {
    function before(caller, nextExecution, created, detail, closed, advanced, tries, id, type, remainingtries) {
        detail.from &= ".de";
        return arguments.detail;
    }

    function after(caller, created, detail, closed, lastExecution, advanced, tries, id, type, passed, remainingtries) {
        systemOutput(arguments.keyList(), 1, 1);
    }
}
```
