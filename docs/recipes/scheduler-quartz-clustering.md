# Clustering with Quartz Scheduler

This recipe provides detailed instructions for setting up and configuring clustering with the Quartz Scheduler extension for Lucee.

For a general overview of the Quartz Scheduler extension, see the [Quartz Scheduler documentation](https://github.com/lucee/lucee-docs/blob/master/docs/recipes/scheduler-quartz.md).

## Overview

Clustering in Quartz Scheduler allows you to distribute your scheduled tasks across multiple servers, providing:

- **High Availability**: If one server fails, others continue to execute scheduled tasks
- **Load Distribution**: Job execution is distributed across multiple servers
- **Scalability**: Add more servers to handle increasing workloads

## Prerequisites

- Lucee 6.2 or 7.0 with the Quartz Scheduler extension installed
- A shared database or Redis instance accessible by all cluster nodes
- Proper network connectivity between all cluster nodes

## Storage Options for Clustering

Quartz Scheduler supports two types of storage for clustering:

1. **Database Storage**: Uses a relational database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.
2. **Redis Storage**: Uses Redis as a distributed data store

### Database Storage Setup

#### 1. Create the Database

You'll need to create a database and user with sufficient privileges. Here's an example for MySQL:

```sql
-- Create the database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS quartz;

-- Create a dedicated user (recommended)
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'qs'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH caching_sha2_password BY 'strongpassword';

-- Grant necessary privileges
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON quartz.* TO 'qs'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;

-- Apply the changes
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

#### 2. Create Database Tables

Quartz Scheduler needs specific tables in your database. While the extension will attempt to create these tables automatically, you may need to create them manually if the database user doesn't have sufficient privileges.

You can find database-specific scripts in the official Quartz repository:

- MySQL: [tables_mysql_innodb.sql](https://github.com/quartznet/quartznet/blob/main/database/tables/tables_mysql_innodb.sql)
- PostgreSQL: [tables_postgres.sql](https://github.com/quartznet/quartznet/blob/main/database/tables/tables_postgres.sql)
- Oracle: [tables_oracle.sql](https://github.com/quartznet/quartznet/blob/main/database/tables/tables_oracle.sql)
- SQL Server: [tables_sqlServer.sql](https://github.com/quartznet/quartznet/blob/main/database/tables/tables_sqlServer.sql)

#### 3. Configure the Datasource in Lucee

Create a datasource in the Lucee Administrator:

1. Navigate to Server/Web Admin > Datasources
2. Add a new datasource with the appropriate settings
3. Verify the connection is successful

#### 4. Configure Quartz Scheduler to Use the Datasource

Update your Quartz Scheduler configuration to use the datasource:

```json
{
  "store": {
    "type": "datasource",
    "datasource": "quartz",
    "tablePrefix": "QRTZ_",
    "cluster": true,
    "clusterCheckinInterval": "15000",
    "misfireThreshold": "60000"
  }
}
```

### Redis Storage Setup

#### 1. Install and Configure Redis

Ensure Redis is installed and accessible from all cluster nodes.

#### 2. Configure Quartz Scheduler to Use Redis

Update your Quartz Scheduler configuration to use Redis:

```json
{
  "store": {
    "type": "redis",
    "host": "redis.example.com",
    "port": 6379,
    "keyPrefix": "QRTZ_",
    "password": "${REDIS_PASSWORD}",
    "redisCluster": false,
    "redisSentinel": false,
    "database": 0,
    "lockTimeout": 30000,
    "ssl": false,
    "misfireThreshold": 60000
  }
}
```

## How Clustering Works

In a clustered environment, Quartz Scheduler ensures that each job is executed by exactly one node in the cluster:

- If a job has a trigger set to fire every 10 seconds, at exactly 12:00:00, only one node will run the job
- At 12:00:10, again only one node will run the job
- It won't necessarily be the same node each time - the execution is distributed across the cluster

The load-balancing mechanism is:

- Near-random for busy schedulers with many triggers
- Favors the same node that was just active for schedulers with fewer triggers

This behavior is normal and should not be manually adjusted. It ensures efficient resource utilization across the cluster while maintaining the integrity of your scheduled tasks.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Database Permission Errors

If you see errors like `Table 'quartz.QRTZ_TRIGGERS' doesn't exist`, check:

1. The database user has sufficient privileges to create tables
2. The tables exist in the database
3. The table prefix in your configuration matches the actual tables

#### Clock Synchronization Issues

For clustering to work properly, all servers should have synchronized clocks. Use NTP to keep server clocks in sync.

#### Connection Issues

Ensure all nodes can connect to the storage backend (database or Redis) and that connection limits aren't being exceeded.

## Custom Logging

When running in a clustered environment, you may want to configure custom log files to track job execution across the cluster. Since Quartz Scheduler runs as an event gateway instance, you can configure custom logging through the event gateway settings in the Lucee Administrator.

You can also configure listeners to log job execution to a specific location:

```json
{
  "listeners": [
    {
      "component": "path.to.LoggingListener",
      "stream": "err",
      "logFile": "/path/to/quartz-cluster.log"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Fine-Tuning Cluster Settings

For optimal performance in a clustered environment, consider the following settings:

```json
{
  "store": {
    "type": "datasource",
    "datasource": "quartz",
    "tablePrefix": "QRTZ_",
    "cluster": true,
    "clusterCheckinInterval": "15000",
    "misfireThreshold": "60000",
    "acquireTriggersWithinLock": "true",
    "lockHandler.class": "org.quartz.impl.jdbcjobstore.UpdateLockRowSemaphore"
  }
}
```

- **clusterCheckinInterval**: How often (in milliseconds) a node checks in with the cluster
- **misfireThreshold**: How long (in milliseconds) a trigger can be late before it's considered misfired
- **acquireTriggersWithinLock**: Important for clustered environments to prevent race conditions

## Conclusion

Clustering with Quartz Scheduler provides robust, distributed task scheduling for your Lucee applications. By setting up a shared storage backend and configuring your nodes correctly, you can achieve high availability and scalability for your scheduled tasks.

Remember that the key to successful clustering is proper configuration of both the storage backend and the Quartz Scheduler itself, as well as ensuring all nodes in the cluster have synchronized clocks and reliable network connectivity.
