menuTitle: Compatibility / Migration
---

Whilst Lucee is broadly compatible with Adobe ColdFusion, there are some differences.

Some are for performance reasons, others due to Adobe mis-adopting or adding features which conflict with Lucee additions to the language. Sometimes it's a trade off between being compatible and respecting our existing users.

Our issue tracker has an [acf-compat](https://luceeserver.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=labels%20%3D%20%22acf-compat%22)  label which tracks all the known differences.
